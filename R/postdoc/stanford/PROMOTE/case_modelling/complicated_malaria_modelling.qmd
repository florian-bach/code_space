## Intro

Modelling the incidence of complicated and severe malaria using the 2014 Gonçalves *et al.* NEJM dataset revealed that the risk of both severe and complicated malaria decreased over time. We tested linear, stepwise and exponential decay models and for both complicated malaria and severe-only malaria; exponential provided the best fit (though for severe linear was equally good). Those models are shown here.

:::

For both complicated and severe malaria, the risk was highest in first infections. Contrary to what the authors said in the paper, the risk was not stable, but decayed with each order of infection. A limitation of this dataset is that I only had access to aggregate data, as the authors did not respond to our request to send us individual-level data. This means that it's impossible to correct for repeat measures. I don't thinkt that's a huge issue because almost nobody got complicated malaria more than once.

Regardless, I was curious what this relationship looked like in the PROMOTE dataset, where individual level data is available together with important covariates like age, parasitaemia *etc*.

## Data Generation

Here's how I generated the data: Only look at only incident episodes; split data by individual, count number of episodes for each child. Once this is known, the order of infection can be assigned easily based on the child's age at each episode. The number of complicated episodes at first infections divided by the total number of first infections thus gives a probability we can model as the order infection increases. This is what worked best in the Gonçalves dataset.

The shape of the data is well approximated by a quadratic model, both the linear and quadratic coefficients for n_infection are significant. Model error is much wider at high orders of infection, which makes sense, because we have relatively little data here. The fractions at the top show the number of complicated cases over the total number of cases. It appears as though the risk of the first two malaria infections of life is pretty low, around infection number 4 the risk peaks before dropping off sharply.

In my previous work in human challenge models, as well as the Gonçalves dataset, first infections were the most likely cause disease. So I was surprised to see risk of first infections being significantly lower than reinfections. There were a number of possible explanations for this humped relationship that I wanted to address:

1.  could the shape of this curve be driven by including low-level infections which the Gonçalves paper would have missed (they only used thick blood smears)?

2.  Could there be residual protection by maternal antibodies & fetal haemoglobin early in life that wanes over time?

3.  Could it be that it matters when an infant's first infection occurs while very young (under four/six/eight months)?

While there undoubtedly exist protective associations in very young kids, this humped relationship is present in older children too, and also when low-level infections are excluded. This suggests that host-specific adaptation first increases risk (for example through (innate?) priming which increases inflammation) before protective immunity is developed. What I think is relevant is that the vast majority of kids that experience a complicated episode never do so again.

# So 3 kids have complicated malaria twice, and 2 have it thrice. Lots of kids with multiple uncomplicated infections, up to 10!
```

## Model Selection

Next, I was curious to explore that relationship using individual level data. I included `id` as a random effect because there's a lot of variability in how many measurements are available for each kid.

Now we can see whether the relationship between order of infection and the risk of severe malaria holds up when we include important covariates such as age (continuous or categorical, i.e. over and under six months of age) and parasitaemia.

knitr::kable(model_results_df, row.names = FALSE)%>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 16)

```

A $\Delta~AIC < -4$ is often used to "justify" the inclusion of a model parameter. In isolation neither age nor log10 parasitaemia improved model fit significantly, though higher parasitaemia and higher age were both significantly associated with complicated malaria. I'm not yet convinced the p value for age is trustworthy because there's an obvious correlation with n_infection, but this shouldn't matter for goodness of fit metrics like AIC. Including age without n_infection led to inferior model fit, with or without parasitaemia as a covariate, relative to models that included n_infection as well. This is noteworthy I think.

Adding both age and parasitaemia together provided slightly more explanatory power, without overfitting too much. Interestingly, including an interaction between n_infection (either linear or quadratic) and age did not significantly improve model fit. This suggests that age during infection does not impact the "shape" of the relationship between order of infection and complicated malaria risk. Instead, older age is associated with a higher risk generally, but we would predict a similar peak and rapid decline with increasing order of infection. More on that in a little bit.

In all models, n_infection remained a significant coefficient. Including the combination of age and parasitaemia increased the overall variance explained from 29% to 32%, with about half of all variance explained by fixed effects. That in itself is quite an interesting observation I think, that individual identity remains a highly significant contributor to complicated malaria risk, even when incorporating age and parasitaemia.

## Teasing Apart Order of Infection and Age

The previous regression analysis suggested that the order of infection has a significant impact on the risk of malaria infection, more so than age. Age, however, clearly forms part of that equation, since higher order infections need to occur, by definition, at higher ages within individuals.

I believe it is important to distinguish between these two correlated metrics. If age at first infection is important, variation in transmission intensity should shift the risk dynamics of infections, as mosquito inoculation rate is the main (natural) determinant of when first infections occur. Similarly, interventions like chemoprevention would shift the age of first infections, impacting risk of complicated malaria later in life (possibly as rebound malaria).

In contrast, if the order of infection is the most important, then modifying age at first infection does not matter. In that case, cessation of chemoprevention or vaccine protection should not lead to any appreciable rebound malaria. Interestingly, to me, the literature on rebound malaria is not very clear cut, though it does seem to occur in some instances. Perhaps this points to a limited age window within which first infections carry a particular risk, so the shifting the age of first infection may only be relevant when it happens to push risk in or out of this window.

Anyway, back to the stats. If age impacts malaria risk, I figured this should be reflected in the age range that presents with complicated malaria. On average of course it does, but what does it look like when we split up infections by their order?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 4.2
#| warning: false

complicated_data %>%
  filter(n_infection<7)%>%
  ggplot(., aes(y=age, x=complicatedmalaria, group=factor(complicatedmalaria, levels = c("uncomplicated", "complicated")), fill=complicatedmalaria))+
  facet_wrap(~n_infection)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  #geom_violin()+
  ggtitle("Age range at each order of infection, stratified by disease severity")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("uncomplicated"="#FC6A03",
                               "complicated"="darkred"))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())



```

So complicated cases tended to appear in slightly older children. Interestingly, the age distributions were not significantly different during individual infections (e.g. first infection; two-sample t test, p=0.2148). However, age was significantly different when combining data of the first two (p=0.01561) or three (p=0.00036) infections, thus in agreement with the previously described regression model. So age appears to matter to an extent, at least in the first few infections of life, but the effect isn't huge.

Next I decided to flip the above data on its head and ask what the risk of complicated malaria is for each age group at each order of infection. To do this I split the data into kids over and under six month, and then for each order of infection calculate the complicated malaria risk by dividing the number of complicated cases by the total number of cases.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: age distribution in severe and non-severe

suppressWarnings(age_n_inf_nest <- complicated_data %>%
  filter(n_infection<5)%>%
  group_by(n_infection, age_cat) %>%
  nest() %>%
  #mutate(model=purrr::map(data, ~glm(comp_num~age_cat, data=., family = "binomial"))) %>%
  mutate(confy_model=purrr::map(data, ~glm(comp_num~1, data=., family="binomial")),
         coef=purrr::map(confy_model, ~exp(coef(.))),
         upper=purrr::map(confy_model, ~exp(confint(.))[2]),
         lower=purrr::map(confy_model, ~exp(confint(.))[1]))%>%
  unnest(data)%>%
  dplyr::select(n_infection, age_cat, coef, upper, lower)%>%
  unnest())
  #mutate(age_cat=factor(age_cat, levels=c("under six months", "over six months")))



ggplot(age_n_inf_nest, aes(x = age_cat, y = coef, color=age_cat))+
  facet_wrap(~ n_infection)+
  geom_point(aes(x = age_cat, y = coef)) + 
  geom_linerange(aes(x = age_cat,  ymin = lower, ymax = upper), lwd = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("Risk of Complicated Malaria")+
  scale_color_manual(values=age_cat_palette)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank())



# 

```

Here again we see that there may be a difference, but it's not huge. At no order of infection are the confidence intervals far enough apart that the means would be significantly different. Though of course splitting the data like that loses us a lot of degrees of freedom.

# Causal Mediation analysis
# 
# To further probe the relationship between order of infection, age and complicated malaria risk, I decided to try causal mediation analysis. The question is to what extent the protective effect present at higher order infections is mediated my increased host age. I tested age as a mediator in two ways: age in years as a continuous variable, and age as a binary variable of older or younger than six months. I used the mediation package for this which appears to be the standard in the field. Checked for three mediators to malaria risk: age, n_infection and parasite density (might as well).


# Parasite density did not mediate risk significantly. Both n_infection and age did (most easily interpretable for age as a categorical variable). However, n_infection mediated significantly more of the total effect than age.

# models with continuous age
