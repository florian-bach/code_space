diffcyt_boxplot         This function makes boxplots of the frequency
                        or cell count of each cluster that's been
                        determined to be differentially abundant using
                        diffcyt.
flo_umap                This function makes pretty UMAP plots. It takes
                        a dataframe as input and uses the UMAP1 and
                        UMAP2 columns as X and Y coordinates and any
                        other named column as the coloring variable. It
                        can facet by one variable.
prep_sce_for_ggplot     This function makes data.frames when passed
                        SingleCellExperiments. This allows making
                        ggplot objects from scratch using sce data.
read_full               This function simplifies and streamlines
                        reading the full vac69a cytof dataset into R It
                        relies on the packages flowCore, CATALYST and
                        deplyr and their dependcies (e.g.
                        SingleCellExperiment)
read_small              This function simplifies and streamlines
                        reading a subsampled version of the vac69a
                        cytof dataset into R It relies on the packages
                        flowCore, CATALYST and deplyr and their
                        dependcies (e.g. SingleCellExperiment)
