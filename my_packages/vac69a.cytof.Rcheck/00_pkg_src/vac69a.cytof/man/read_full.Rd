\title{This function simplifies and streamlines reading the full vac69a cytof dataset into R
It relies on the packages flowCore, CATALYST and deplyr and their dependcies (e.g. SingleCellExperiment)}
\usage{
read_full(path_to_directory)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_directory}{character string; path to the directory containing metadata, panel, fcs files and clustering marker names}
}
\value{
a SingleCellExperiment containing all fcs files in the directory & FlowSOM clustering results
}
\description{
The working directory needs to contain all of the following:
1) The fcs files to be read into the flowSet
2) A csv file containing metadata ("file_name", "sample_id", "timepoint", "batch", "volunteer")
3) A cvs file containing the panel ("fcs_colname", "antigen", "marker_class")
4) A csv file containing the names of markers to be considered for clustering
}
\details{
The seed for clustering is set to 123, 100 clusters, 50 metaclusters
The list of markers to consider for clustering is located in refined_markers.csv in the same directory as the fcs files
}

# you can call the resulting variable anything other than sce (sce is the internal name) #
